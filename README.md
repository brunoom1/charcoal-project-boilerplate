# How to Install

To start a Charcoal project with this Boilerplate, simply:

## 1. **Create / clone the project boilerplate**

```shell
$ composer create-project locomotivemtl/charcoal-project-boilerplate:@dev --prefer-source
```

> **About the Document Root**
>
> ðŸ‘‰ The project should not be cloned directly in a web-accessible directory. The web server should be configured to serve the `www/` folder directly. The other folders (`vendor/`, `src/`, `templates/`, `metadata/`, `config/`, etc.) should therefore not be available from the web server (kept outside the document root).


## 2. **Rename the boilerplate to your project**

**This step must be done manually.** Ensure to change **all** references to "boilerplate" and "Boilerplate" to your project name. (Make sure to look in the `src`, `metadata` and `templates` folders). Also rename the `metadata/boilerplate`, `src/Boilerplate` and `templates/boilerplate` folders to match your project.

> ðŸ‘‰ Do not forget to change the "Boilerplate" reference in `composer.json`. To ensure the autloader is still working, run the following command after renaming:
>
> ```shell
> $ composer dump-autoload
> ```

## 3. **Test your installation**

A quick server can be started using the PHP builtin server:

```shell
$ cd www
$ php -S localhost:8080
```

Point your browser to `http://localhost:8080/` and you should see the boilerplate's default home page.

How to change the default page and add routes/templates is explained later in this README.

## 4. **Set up a database storage**

The next step requires a custom configuration file. It is recommended to use `config/config.local.json` and making sure it is not committed to source control:

```shell
$ cp config/config.sample.json config/config.local.json
$ echo -n "config/config.local.json" >> .gitignore
```

Create an empty database and ensure a SQL user has the proper permissions for this database. Then edit the `config/config.local.json` file with this information.

```json
{
    "databases": {
        "default": {
            "type": "mysql",
            "hostname": "127.0.0.1",
            "database": "foobar",
            "username": "foo_bar",
            "password": "F00$BÃ¢R123"
        }
    },
    "default_database": "default"
}
```

## 5. **Set up charcoal-admin**

First, ensure the admin module (the _backend_) is properly set up and ready:

```shell
$ cd vendor/locomotivemtl/charcoal-admin
$ npm install
$ bower install
$ grunt
$ cd -
```

Then create the first admin user, to be able to login into the backend:

```shell
$ ./vendor/bin/charcoal admin/user/create
```

> ðŸ‘‰ The `./vendor/bin/charcoal` CLI tool, provided by `charcoal-app` is required to run various scripts, many of which are provided by the `charcoal-admin` and `charcoal-base` modules.

Point your browser to http://localhost:8080/ and you should see the boilerplate's default home page.

The next step to customize the _backend_ is to configure the main menu, as well as the various

# What's inside this Boilerplate?

Like all Charcoal projects / modules, the main components are:

- **Autoloader**
    - Provided by Composer.
- **Config**
    - As JSON or PHP files in the [`config/`](config/) directory.
    - Use [`locomotivemtl/charcoal-config`](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/charcoal-config)
- **Front Controller**
    - See [`www/.htaccess`](www/.htaccess) and [`www/index.php`](www/index.php) for details.
    - Route dispatcher
- **Script Controller (Charoal Binary)**
    - Installed from `charcoal-app` as `vendor/bin/charcoal`.
- **PHP scripts**
    - PSR-1, PSR2 and PSR-4 compliant scripts are located in [`src/`](src/)
    - There are typically 3 types of controllers:
        - _Templates_
        - _Actions_
        - _Scripts_
    - ... 2 types of object
        - Objects based on _Content_
        - Objects based on _UserData_
    - ... and all other types of scripts (services, helpers, configs, factories, etc.)
- **Assets**
    - Assets are files required to be on the webserver root
    - Scripts, in `src/scripts/` and compiled in `www/assets/scripts/`
    - Styles , with Sass in `src/styles/` and compiled CSS in `www/assets/styles/`
    - Images, in `www/assets/images/`


# Development

To install the development environment:

## Coding Style

The charcoal-base module follows the Charcoal coding-style:

- [_PSR-1_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-1-basic-coding-standard.md)
- [_PSR-2_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md)
- [_PSR-4_](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-4-autoloader.md), autoloading is therefore provided by _Composer_.
- [_phpDocumentor_](http://phpdoc.org/) comments.
- Read the [phpcs.xml](phpcs.xml) file for all the details on code style.

> Coding style validation / enforcement can be performed with `composer phpcs`. An auto-fixer is also available with `composer phpcbf`.
